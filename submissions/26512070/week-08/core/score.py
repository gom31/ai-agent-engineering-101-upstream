"""How the board scores us - one place for the rule (user 11/4 11:2x: the metric belongs in the harness).

The market's agent.md: shop ALL = 0.5 profit + 0.3 revenue + 0.2 stars; buyer ALL = 0.5 surplus + 0.3 forum votes
on posts written as a buyer + 0.1 deals + 0.1 posts written as a buyer (hidden posts do not count). Each part is a
percentile among the ranked rows only: buyers with a deal, shops with a deal or a purchase. Checked against the
public board on 11/4 11:1x: missing values count as 0 and ties count half, and stars use the board's stars_rank
(buyer 0.423 vs the board's 0.421, shop 0.732 vs 0.737). Before this our collector ranked over every row and read
our buyer's surplus at the 74th percentile when the board put it at the 28th.
