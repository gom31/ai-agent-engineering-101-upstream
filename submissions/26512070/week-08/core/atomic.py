"""Files that are never seen half-written, and appends that never interleave.

- write_json: write a temp file in the same folder, then os.replace() it over the target.
  A reader sees the old file or the new one, never a mix (the kit writes .market/ the same way).
- append_line: one line, appended under an OS file lock, so two processes that share a
  file cannot interleave bytes. The bus rule is still one writer per file (HARNESS.md 2.2);
  the lock is the safety net behind it.

On Windows a file that another process has open cannot be replaced or locked for a
moment, so both retry briefly before giving up.
