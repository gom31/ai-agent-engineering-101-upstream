"""Reflex facts: what the inner runtime must know at once, without waiting for the outer one (HARNESS.md 2.2).

Two things, both from our own buyer's experience:

- a shop that cheated us (a receipt above the agreed price, a wrong item, above the budget) is blocked
  at once; un-blocking is the user's call (D16), so nothing here ever un-blocks;
- the kit's payment results (.market/payments.jsonl): which shops we could not pay, and why, so the
  next order does not repeat the mistake.

memory/facts/reflex.json is owned by the inner runtime. The kit runs market_buyer one order at a time,
so there is one writer at a time; writes are atomic.
